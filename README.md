## ðŸ“– Overview  
Brain age estimation has emerged as a promising biomarker for characterizing individual brain health and detecting deviations from normative aging. AMAge-Net introduces a **novel attention-guided fusion framework** that integrates **structural MRI (sMRI)** and **functional MRI (fMRI)** to more accurately model aging trajectories.  

**Key highlights**  
- **Modality-specific encoders** extract complementary features from sMRI and fMRI.  
- **Attention-guided cross-modal fusion** learns shared representations while preserving modality-specific information.  
- **Interpretability** via saliency analysis, identifying brain regions contributing to aging predictions.  
- **Superior performance** compared to baseline methods on large-scale multimodal datasets.
